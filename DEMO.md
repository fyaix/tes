## Sample Test Data

If you want to test with actual working VPN accounts, you'll need to:

1. Replace the demo links with real VPN subscription links
2. Ensure you have network connectivity
3. The testing will show real latency and connectivity results

## Troubleshooting Demo Issues

### Port Already in Use
```bash
# Use different port
python -c "from app import app, socketio; socketio.run(app, host='0.0.0.0', port=5001)"
```

### Dependencies Missing
```bash
pip install flask flask-socketio python-dotenv requests
```

### Mobile Access Issues
1. Ensure your computer and phone are on the same network
2. Use your computer's IP address instead of localhost
3. Disable firewall temporarily if needed

## Performance Notes

- Demo links will fail connection tests (they're not real servers)
- Real VPN links will show actual latency and connectivity
- Testing speed depends on your network connection
- Mobile performance is optimized for touch interactions
